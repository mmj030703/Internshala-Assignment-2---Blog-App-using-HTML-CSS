## Theme

### Four Main Colors are used in the Palete.

- Primary Color : rgb(180, 22, 180);
- Secondary Color : rgb(161, 32, 161);
- Tertiary Color : rgb(0, 0, 0);
- Complementary Color : rgb(48, 213, 200);

## Reason for choosing this theme
- The reason for choosing this theme was that I like more often light theme which is clean and simple and that's the major reason behind the above color palete and design for the UI.

## Challenges Faced

### 1) Deciding the theme was the most difficult part of the whole process of making this webpage.
- I searched a lot for the colors which compliment each other and from there after trying many colors on the webpage I came up with the above color palete. 

### 2) Underline Animation was bit challenging 
- I had a thought of doing something like this animation but I didn't know how to start and then I took help from the youtube and implemented this animation which looks good.
